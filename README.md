# üî∑ Flutter Pok√©dex üî¥
 A Pok√©dex mobile application made with Flutter and Pok√©Api. This application serves as a motivating practice project incorporating APIs in a Flutter app.

 For those unfamiliar, a Pok√©dex is a portable electronic encyclopedia that Pok√©mon trainers use to record information about Pok√©mon. It's a common feature in the Pok√©mon franchise, first appearing in Pok√©mon Red Version and Pok√©mon Blue Version.

 The UI/UX design was heavily influenced by [Flavio Faris](https://dribbble.com/shots/11114913-Pok-dex-App) and [Don Bailon's](https://dribbble.com/shots/2917684-www-pokeweak-com) Pok√©dex designs in ![Dribbbble.](https://dribbble.com/)
